                <p class="text">1. Amy Tangerine is a master at making everyday look amazing. Making “lists of likes”
                    (poll
                    the kids, hubby or dog) is an excellent mile-marker for scrapbooking.
                    2. Section off a page with colorful Washi tape, then fill one of the sections with text about the
                    photo/day you are highlighting. Leaving negative space on the page helps you take it all in and
                    appreciate the beauty of the moment, as well as the details you’ve recorded.
                    3. This interview-style layout could be used for graduates who are ready to take on the world. Love
                    the
                    way A Beautiful Mess put this page together.
                    There are SO many ways to make travel memories last a lifetime. Snap pictures during your time on
                    the
                    long airplane or car ride, save maps from your road-trip, or arrange the scraps from some of your
                    favorite haunts to make vacation memory scrapbooking (ok, ok, and shadow-box displays) easy as pie.
                    (Scientific reminder: any pie eaten while on vacation results in weight LOSS, not gain. It’s
                    vacation
                    science.). Read on for the perfect travel scrapbook inspiration.
                    4. If scrapbooking an entire vacation or child’s young life seems too daunting, take this concept
                    and
                    run with it! Boil it all down to one event per month and presto! We spotted this brilliant idea on
                    Balzer Designs.
                    5. This page from Studio Calico demonstrates how adorable a series of shots from an airplane can
                    look.
                    6. Maps are put to good use in this page from Martha Stewart’s site.
                    7. Take a cue from this Athletes Abroad page and put spare pics to work as city names.
                    Instant cameras and film are ridiculously fun, creative ways for making and sharing memories. Paste
                    them
                    into books, with as much or as little text as you desire, or pick a wall in your home/office to
                    create a
                    personalized art installation. They can be used to make a baby book or be more travel-centric. Also,
                    whether you have a classic Polaroid or a new Instax, they are so easy to use, that your kids can
                    have
                    their own roll of film to capture memories of their own. Photo strips from photo booths work great,
                    too!
                    8. Jessica Rose of Volume Twenty Five used a very minimal set-up to assemble this instant photo
                    scrapbook.

                    Instax photos are another great way to capture life’s special moments and scrappergirl, Adrienne
                    Alvis,
                    and the folks from Urban Outfitters each have their own unique take on assembling those
                    Instax-captured
                    memories.
                    12. Kelly Purkey relied on photos of all shapes and sizes to tell the story of her travels to
                    Vietnam in this inspiring scrapbook album.
                    13. Project Life simplifies scrapbooking with stylish pre-fab inserts and pockets for your photos.
                    This spread from Eighteen25 includes a creative cut of an 8″x10″.
                    14. Another A Beautiful Mess page because, colors, you guys. And can we go on vacation with the ABM
                    girls please and thank you.
